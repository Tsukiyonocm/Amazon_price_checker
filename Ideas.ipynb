This would save a lot of space and make the overall code base look a bit nicer. Also look into a better way to store the snippets of code we do need to get. This will play a bit in the future as well as the database or JSON would be needed to change this to a tracker later on.\n",

I am curious if I could reform my scraping code in order to look for this class, instead of the ID that I am currently using to find them, kindle-price. If this can be done, it would save me a good bit of code lines since I wouldnt need to create seperate variables in order to find all the prices inside of list. (Though I might still need to have seperate lists because of breaking the lists down to save space)."
